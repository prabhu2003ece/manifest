# Manifests

The files in this repository are referred to as "manifests" and are
used by the jiri tool for multi-repository management. Each manifest
describes a set of projects and each project consists of a remote
repository, a local path, and other optional attributes.

Backwards incompatible changes to the manifest format are deployed by
creating a new 'version' subdirectory (e.g. v2) and a new default
manifest (e.g. v2/default), which is used by new versions of the jiri
tool by default. The format of existing manifest files should not be
changed, as old versions of the jiri tool would not be able to parse
them.

To add a project to an existing Vanadium universe, one should add it
to the relevant manifest for all versions that are still supported,
following the format of the respective versions.

Further, the set of projects that form a Vanadium universe should be
closed under transitive closure with respect to dependencies. In other
words, if a project A depends on a project B, then project A should
only be included in manifests that include project B as well.

# Code search

The repo/default.xml file is used to configure code search used
internally.
