MANIFESTS
=========

The files in this repository are referred to as "manifests" and
are used by the veyron tool for multi-repository management. Each
manifest describes a set of projects and each project consist of a
remote repository, a local path, and other optional attributes.

Backwards incompatible changes to the manifest format are deployed by
creating a new 'version' subdirectory (e.g. v2) and a new default
manifest (e.g. v2/default), which is used by new versions of the
veyron tool by default. Format of existing manifest files should not
be changed as old versions of the veyron tool would not be able to
parse them.
