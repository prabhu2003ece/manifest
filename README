=========
MANIFESTS
=========

The files in the manifest directory are referred to as "manifests" and
are used by the veyron tool for multi-repository management. Each
manifest describes a set of projects and each project consist of a
remote repository, a local path, and other optional attributes.

Backwards incompatible changes to the manifest format are deployed by
creating a new 'version' subdirectory (e.g. manifest/v2) amd a new
default manifest (e.g. manifest/v2/default.xml), which is used by new
versions of the veyron tool by default. Format of existing manifest
files should not be changed as old versions of the veyron tool, that
uses the old manifest files, would not be able to parse them.

==================
BUILD ENVIRONMENTS
==================

The files in the 'buildenv' directory are referred to as "build
environments" and are used to specify snapshots of a set of veyron
repositories. In particular, each build environment describes a
mapping from veyron projects to revisions.

Unlike manifests, once created, build environment files should not be
modified as the purpose of build files is to provide snapshots that
are constant in time.

Like manifests, backwards incompatible changes to the build
environment format are deployed by creating a new 'version'
subdirectory. Format of existing build environment files should not be
changed as old versions of the veyron tool, that uses the old build
environment files, would not be able to parse them.
