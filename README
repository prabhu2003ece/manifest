# Manifests

The files in this repository are referred to as "manifests" and are used by the
jiri tool for multi-repository management. Each manifest describes a set of
projects and each project consists of a remote repository, a local path, and
other optional attributes.

The set of projects that form a Vanadium universe should be closed under
transitive closure with respect to dependencies. In other words, if a project A
depends on a project B, then project A should only be included in manifests
that include project B as well.

# Code search

The repo/default.xml file is used to configure code search used internally.
