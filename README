The files in this repository are referred to as "manifests" and are
used by the veyron tool for multi-repository management. Each manifest
describe a set of projects and each project consist of a remote
repository, a local path, and other optional attributes.

NOTE: Backwards incompatible changes to the manifest format are
deployed by creating a new manifest file and updating the veyron tool
that uses the new format to use the new manifest file by
default. Format of old manifest files should not be changed as old
versions of the veyron tool, that uses the old manifest files by
default, would not be able to parse them.
